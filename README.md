- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pantoffel97
- 👀 I’m interested in modeling an ACC Motor, Gearbox & Fan system in MATLAB Simulink.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about designing unit tests for each subsystem to validate before assembling into the larger system model.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dynamic modeling avaialble for these systems that exist in the Simulink environment.
- 📫 Anyone can contact me via email: christovr17@gmail.com / 19840918@sun.ac.za

Thanks everyone!
